00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
 This is the 20th class of semiconductor engineering.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:19,000
 Today, Iâ€™m going to review and end my laughter on the semiconductor road with Mr.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:36,800
 And from next time, I will do it from next time in Chapter 9 of Integrated Circuits, and I will go for one hour of process review as a pre-work for that.

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,100
 Before that, the most important thing to do today is pets

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:01:04,200
 Before studying the structure, the pre-step is generally called Conventional 1 o'clock in 1 hour.
